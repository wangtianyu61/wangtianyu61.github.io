<h2>Summary of Undergraduate Research Experiences</h2>
<p>
I am deeply impressed by the theoretical and practical beauty of operations research at the end of the second year of my undergraduate studies. 
During my exchange life at National University of Singapore, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href = "https://bizfaculty.nus.edu.sg/faculty-details/?profId=127">Melvyn Sim</a> in robust portfolio optimization.  
Gradually I found the great charm in the interplay between machine learning, statistics and optimization.</p>
<p>Motivated by the big picture between optimization and statistic, 
I went on designing better procedures in estimation and optimization steps in data-driven revenue management working with Professor <a href = "http://www.wuchenye.cn/">Chenye Wu</a> in an SRT project.</p>
<p>During 2020 Summer, I also worked on the project related to model selection in contextual bandit and was advised remotely by Professor <a href = "http://slevi1.mit.edu/">David Simchi-Levi</a>.</p>
